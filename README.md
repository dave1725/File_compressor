# File_Compressor
A text file compression tool based on Huffman encoding algorithm. The tool enjoys the benefit given by huffman encoding algorithm, i.e, Lossless compression.
We can compress the data upto 30-40% without any loss in the data, saving 60-70% space. This comes very handy in case of cloud sharing. 
# UseCase
Imagine you have to send a 1GB data file, and you only have 500MB of internet data. No need to worry! Huffman encoding algorithm got you. After compression the file's size becomes somewhere around 300MB which can now be safely sent without any problems.
# Getting Started
## Step1 : 
Clone the repository(make sure git is installed)
git clone https://github.com/dave1725/File_compressor.git

## Step2 : 
Compile the project source file using g++ or any compiler
Make sure MingW is installed for windows and OSX. 
For linus install g++.
        apt-get install g++
        
## Step3 : 
Finally! Run the project executable file.
