# File_Compressor
A text file compression tool based on Huffman encoding algorithm. The tool enjoys the benefit given by huffman encoding algorithm, i.e, Lossless compression.
We can compress the data upto 30-40% without any loss in the data, saving 60-70% space. This comes very handy in case of cloud sharing. 
[UseCase]
Imagine you have to send a 1GB data file, and you only have 500MB of internet data. No need to worry! Huffman encoding algorithm got you. After compression the file's size becomes somewhere around 300MB which can now be safely sent without any problems.
